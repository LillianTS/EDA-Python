# Exploratory Data Analysis on Crime Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA_python.ipynb`) that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a public crime dataset. The goal is to load, inspect, clean, and visualize crime data in order to uncover patterns, trends, and potential insights.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Perform exploratory analysis on a crime dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, generate summary statistics, and create visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, etc.) that highlight interesting patterns (e.g., temporal trends, geographic hotspots, or outliers).

- **Key Steps:**  
  1. Load and inspect the dataset  
  2. Check for missing or anomalous values  
  3. Generate descriptive statistics  
  4. Produce data visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmap, time-series plots, distribution charts)  
  5. Highlight or annotate notable findings

## Dataset Description

- **Filename:** `crime.csv`  
- **Source:** Publicly available crime statistics (you can replace this with the actual source if known)  
- **Typical Columns (may vary):**  
  - `Date`: Date of the reported crime  
  - `District`: District or precinct code  
  - `Category`: Type of crime (e.g., theft, assault)  
  - `Latitude` / `Longitude`: Geographic coordinates  
  - `Incident_Count`: Number of incidents (if aggregated)  
  - Additional features such as `Year`, `Month`, `Hour`, etc.

> _Note: Adjust the column list above according to the actual data fields present in your CSV._
